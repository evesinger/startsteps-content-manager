Imagine you want to build a news web app that shows articles by certain topics.
What you need is:
- a backend that manages articles and topics
- a frontend that shows topics and articles

 At a later step more complex tasks such as:
  - search / filters
  - user management / autentication and authorisation
  - caching
  - concurrency

In this repo, we start with the backend implementation of a simple news management system.
